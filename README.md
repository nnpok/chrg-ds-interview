# Colford-Hubbard Research Group--Technical Interview

*This is part of the interview process for the Colford-Hubbard Research Group at UC Berkeley.*

This assessment is meant to evaluate your familiarity with data processing in R. You are welcome to use the internet as you normally would when programming. When you have completed this task, please make sure to submit your Github repo url to this [Google Form](https://www.google.com).

**Background:** Our lab is working with Kaiser Permanente and the Shoo the Flu program to assess the impact of a flu vaccination program for school-aged children. We have two sites: a control and intervention site. At both sites, Kaiser Permanente has provided vaccination data for the patients living in that district. At the intervention site, the Shoo the Flu program vaccinated children in the flu seasons 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. We want to create a bar chart to show the number of vaccinations per year at each district, and we want to visualize what proportion of those vaccinations are from Kaiser versus Shoo the Flu to assess the increase in vaccination rate provided by Shoo the Flu.
