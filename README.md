# Colford-Hubbard Research Group--Technical Interview

*This is part of the interview process for the Colford-Hubbard Research Group at UC Berkeley.*

### Background

Our lab is working with Kaiser Permanente and the Shoo the Flu program to assess the impact of a flu vaccination program for school-aged children. We have two sites: a control and intervention site. At both sites, Kaiser Permanente has provided vaccination data for the patients living in that district. At the intervention site, the Shoo the Flu program vaccinated children in the flu seasons 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. We want to create a bar chart to show the number of vaccinations per year at each district, and we want to visualize what proportion of those vaccinations are from Kaiser versus Shoo the Flu to assess the increase in vaccination rate provided by Shoo the Flu.
